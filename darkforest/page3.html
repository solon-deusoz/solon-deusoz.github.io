        <p= id="intro">Thank you. It is rare to see someone so mature in these woods. I commend you, doomed one. Your choices are simple.
            Behind one door are twisted versions of the people you love. Despite their appearances, they are not who you know. They are the entity 
            assuming the shape of the people you love. You can either fight them off or become one with the entity yourself.
