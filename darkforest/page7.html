    <h1>Fight them</h1>
    <p id="intro">Tears fall from your face as you fight them. You don't want to do it but if there's any chance you can see the real them you have to do it. </p>
    <p>Amazing. I didn't expect you to go through with it. Most people succumb to their emotions. 
        Even after I tell them this is the entity and not their family they usually still can't do it. Enjoy your earned freedom. This was your 
        second chance at life. Don't waste it.
