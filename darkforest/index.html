            Hello. I am terribly sorry. I do not know how you got so unlucky as to find yourself here. Most people who find me usually have done something to deserve it. For whatever reason, I do not think this is the case for you.
            Regardless, I hope, for your sake, that you have gotten your affairs in order. 
            It is unlikely that you will ever see the light of day. Just by being here, you are already on the slippery precipice between life and death.
